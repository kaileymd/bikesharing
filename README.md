# Bikesharing in NYC

Bikesharing is popular in Manhattan, New York. What would it take to transfer that business idea to another city?

My Tableau Public Story, ["Bikesharing in NYC"](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kailey2265/viz/Bikesharing_16230371755200/Story1), contains graphs that I believe uncovers the core demographic of those who use bikesharing in New York, and holds the key to establishing a successful bikesharing business in other cities. Please refer to the Tableau Story for a deeper dive into the data.

## Bikesharing: for Tourists or Locals?
The following graphs show the starting and ending locations of unique bike trips. The larger the circle, the more bike trips were taken, and the color represents the user group. As we can see, orange dominates the map - which supports the pie chart depicting Subscribers as over 80% of the userbase.

Customers appear only in certain parts of the city. Further study is necessary to know where exactly these places are, but the use and limited locations suggests single-time special occassions and/or visiting public landmarks, like for tourism.

Subscribers are even throughout the city, suggesting that locals make up the majority of the bikesharing users. The Tableau Story takes a deep dive into user hours, and finds that most bikes are checked out during an average worker's commute time.

## Bikesharing Demographics

As shown in the graphs below, bikesharing is primarily utilized by men.

Even taking the day of the week out of the equation, the heat map shows men are always a higher percentage of bikeshare users. In addition to making more trips, as the graph below shows, men of commuting age also take longer trips.

## Summary
As the primary demographic, working-age men of a given city should be researched to determine the viability of a bikesharing service in the area. I'd suggest:
- Researching the hobbies of men in the downtown area to determine interest in athleticism/outdoor activity as an inclination towards biking.
- The distance of people's communtes in the downtown area to see if biking is a possible option.
